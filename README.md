# 3D Portfolio

## Overview

**3D Portfolio** is a modern web application built with React, leveraging 3D rendering capabilities, dynamic styling, and smooth navigation. The following libraries and tools have been used to bring the project to life:

---

### 1. [react](https://reactjs.org/) & [react-dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html)

The fundamental libraries for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture. **React** focuses on rendering UI, while **React-DOM** handles DOM-specific rendering.

---

### 2. [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/)

A library for managing routing in React applications. It enables smooth navigation between pages, dynamic routes, and browser history handling.

---

### 3. [three](https://threejs.org/)

The core **Three.js** library, which powers 3D rendering and animations in web browsers. It provides the foundation for creating immersive 3D experiences.

---

### 4. [@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)

A React renderer for **Three.js**, enabling declarative 3D scene creation with React. It allows seamless integration of Three.js with React's component-based architecture.

---

### 5. [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)

A collection of helpful utilities and pre-built components for working with **React Three Fiber**. It simplifies complex 3D rendering tasks such as loading models, creating controls, and adding effects.

---

### 6. [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It allows you to style components directly in your markup without writing traditional CSS files.

---

### 7. [react-vertical-timeline-component](https://stephane-monnot.github.io/react-vertical-timeline/)

A React component for creating vertical timelines. It helps you display sequential events or milestones in a visually appealing way.

---

### 8. [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

A modern build tool and development server. Itâ€™s incredibly fast and optimized for modern JavaScript frameworks like React. It provides features like hot module replacement (HMR) for an improved developer experience.
